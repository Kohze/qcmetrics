#+TITLE: A General Framework for Quality Control Metrics

* Usage

See =sandbox/code.R= for an illustration

* TODO
** Reporting
There will be a report generting system for  =QcMetrics= (and possible individual =QcMetric=) instances. I will be possible to export static reports in pdf via =knitr=, html via =Nozzle.R1= or =hwriter= (possibly others). Markdown is also a good solution to export to multiple forats. Dynamic reports could be created using =shiny=.

** Applications
Illustrate the usage of =qcmetrics= on different types of data. 
- Usage some code and examples from =arrayQualityMetrics= for microarrays
- Prepare QC pipelines for various proteomics data
- Document the creation of new packages using =qcmetrics= (see project with Wen Bo).

** Serialisation 
- Objects can of course be serialised with =save=.
- See if it is possible to interface with the =qcML= standard.
