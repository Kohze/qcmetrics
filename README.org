#+TITLE: A General Framework for Quality Control Metrics

* Usage

See =sandbox/code.R= for an illustration

* TODO
** Reporting
- [X] html, pdf
- [ ] Add metadata section
- [X] externalise the report-generating code into functions and 
      add a reporter argument to qcReport to provide custom reporting fuctions.
- [ ] Improve nozzle report
- [ ] Dynamic reports could be created using =shiny=.
- [ ] Report customisation
   - [ ] pdf via different template 
   - [ ] TODO html via css - see markdown::mardownToHTML stylecheet arg. Use the template argument in =qcReport= for this too.

** Applications
Illustrate the usage of =qcmetrics= on different types of data. 
- [X] RNA degradation
- [ ] Usage some code and examples from =arrayQualityMetrics= for microarrays
- [ ] Document the creation of new packages using =qcmetrics= (see project with Wen Bo).
- [ ] Prepare QC pipelines for various proteomics data

** Serialisation 
- [X] Objects can of course be serialised with =save=.
- See if it is possible to interface with the =qcML= standard.
