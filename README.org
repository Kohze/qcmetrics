* TODO
** Reporting
- [X] html, pdf
- Improve nozzle report
- Dynamic reports could be created using =shiny=.

** Applications
Illustrate the usage of =qcmetrics= on different types of data. 
- Usage some code and examples from =arrayQualityMetrics= for microarrays
- Document the creation of new packages using =qcmetrics= (see project with Wen Bo).
- Prepare QC pipelines for various proteomics data

** Serialisation 
- [X] Objects can of course be serialised with =save=.
